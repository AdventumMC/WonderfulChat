/**
 * IChatter is the representation of a Player for our plugin.
 * It allows us to know which Channel the player is listening to.
 *
 * There are normally 2 IChatter implementations inside of WonderfulChat.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>FutureChatter</li>
 *     <li>SimpleChatter</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Both have really specific usages but if you go through the plugin,
 * it is also useful for your own implementations but I recommend doing your owns.
 *
 * However if you go through the AccountProvider, everything should be ok.
